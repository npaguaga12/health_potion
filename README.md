# health_potion
Built health potion using Python

Created a script named health.py. The objective was to create a player with a base health, then a potion that randomly generated a certain amount of health to give to the player, based on the difficulty of a certain task. Difficulty system ranged from 1-3, from easy-hard. Imported the random module in order to used random.randint. Converted potion_health to integer in order to avoid dealing with float.
